# FA23-Redirected-Walking

The Redirected Waking project introduces a novel VR application that enables users to explore expansive, procedurally generated environments within a limited physical space. Utilizing 'impossible spaces' and 'redirected walking' techniques, it overcomes physical space constraints, allowing a rich and immersive experience in a 4x4 meter room. The project addresses challenges in spatial perception and virtual-physical space integration, setting the foundation for future enhancements in virtual environment navigation and object mapping.
