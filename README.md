# FA23-3D-Redirected-Walking

This is the project we developed for the 3d User Interfaces course at CSU in Fall 2023. 

Redirected walking is a method in virtual reality locomotion that allows users to navigate a virtual environment much larger than the physical space they have available. In this technique, users are guided through alterations made to the displayed scene, leading them to naturally adjust their position or orientation without realizing it, effectively expanding their exploration within the virtual world. 

# Our Approaches:

“Impossible Spaces with Redirected Walking” - to enhance the illusion  

- Imagine your small room has magic portals that leads to other rooms. If you walk through just   right through the walls, it feels like you are in a completely different place. The trick is to make the transition so smooth that you hardly notice the magic happening.


“Overlapping Spaces” - to maximize space

- Imagine you have a small room in VR and you want to feel like a vast forest with a big mountain. With overlapping spaces, you could arrange the designate different areas of the physical room to a different environment. When you move from one area to another, the VR seamlessly transitions you to different virtual spaces. It feels like multiple worlds in a small room without needing a large physical space.


“Procedural VR Environment Generation” - to dynamically create and modify the virtual environment. Eg : No Man’s Sky 

- One famous example of this is the planets generated in “ No Man’s Sky.” In this game, players can explore 18 quintillion (18,000,000,000,000,000,000) unique planets and moons, which were generated algorithmically by computers.

- The amazing thing about procedural generation is that infinite unique possibilities.

To execute the project, simply compile it and then transfer the built files to the Oculus Quest device.
